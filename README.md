# impulse-calc-2000
 A program to calculate rocket impulse from load cell testing data, with graphing and other additional functions

**DEPRICATED: New version here: https://github.com/denneth9/impulse-calc-2500**

Functions:
- Impulse calculation from kilogram values and a time interval
- Specific impulse in newton seconds and seconds from impulse and propellant weight
- Graph of thrust profile that can be exported to a png
- Peak thrust
- Total thrust time
- Average impulse
- Advanced Error Correction and specific optimizations for my own test data
- A graphic user interface made in windows forms

Based of the calculations found on nakka's amazing site, painstakingly converted to non american units
