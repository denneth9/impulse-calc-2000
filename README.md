# impulse-calc-2000
 A program to get rocket impulse from load cell testing data, with graphing and other additional functions

Functions:
- Impulse calculation from kilogram values and a time interval
- Specific impulse from impulse and propellant weight
- Graph of thrust profile that can be exported to a png
- peak thrust
- total thrust time
- average impulse
- basic error correction (specifically optimized for my propriatery test data, W.I.P)
- a graphic user interface made in windows forms

Based of the calculations found on nakka's amazing site, painstakingly converted to non american units
